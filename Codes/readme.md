Here are the codes which you can refer and i hope with this series you will be able to learn python effectively!!
Also i have provided some files of other formats like, .txt, .jpg, etc. these files have been used for file handling and os module tutorial!

For File Handling and os module programs the folders or directory i am using might be different from yours so please while running the file handling or os_module codes provide
a valid path so that it does not give you an error!

To make it more interesting i have also included 2 projects based on python programming! 
1) Kraber Text Editor (link : https://github.com/akshat12000/Kraber-Text-Editor)
2) Youtube Downloader (link : https://github.com/akshat12000/Youtube_Downloader-Python-)

Note : Please fork this repository and download all the files to the computer and then start because numbering in the original repository is not proper!
